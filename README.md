This is a project called Fitness Page. The application presents a page of fitness exercises that can be found by using a search or by selecting a specific body part from a list. The exercises can be seen in the form of an animated gif. Once an exercise is selected, it is possible to watch a video showing how to perform it, with a redirect to YouTube. Similar exercises and those that require similar equipment are also displayed. The project was done in the React framework using MUI, and the target was to learn how use the API and MUI in React. In the future I would like to focus on improving the RWD of the site.
Below are screenshots of the desktop view and the mobile view.
